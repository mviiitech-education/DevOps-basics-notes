## 📝 `Introduction to IDLE`

- IDLE - Integrated Development and Learning Environment

## 📝 `Difference between Compiler & interpreter`

- A teacher and student example 💭
- A teacher ask to write an essay about "AIM IN LIFE"
- After completing the essay, He gave his an essay to teacher for correction.
- The teacher say a mistake in first line, Hence student went and corrected the mistake.
- After correction, again ...
- So the point is executing line by line is interpreter.
- First check for all error then executing is compiler.

### 📝 compiler vs interpreter

| compiler                                | interpreter                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| c, java is compiler based language      | python is interpreter based language |
| 1st compile fully then execute the code | line by line compile and execute.    |

## 📝 `Assignment operator intro`

- assignment operator in python.
- Here `=` is not about assigning value to a variable. It is actually reference.
- In python there is no concept called pointer.

```python
a = 123
b = 123
print(id(a)) #  140714564323576
print(id(b)) #  140714564323576
```

    input: 1
    code: int(input())

    input: 12.12
    code: float(input())

    input: Hello world
    code: input()

##### multiple values in single line

```python
# example 1:
# input: 1 2 3 4 5
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# example 2:
# input: 12 212 23
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# example 3:
# input: 1.23 2.12 43.3 43.3
li = list(map(float,input().split()))
# example 4:
# input: hari jai krish mani
li = input().split()
```

```python
# input: 12 23 34 53 53
# code example 1
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# code example 2
li = []
temp = input().split()
for item in temp:
    li.append(int(item))
print(li) # [12, 23, 34, 53, 53]
# code example 3
li = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
print(li) # [12, 23, 34, 53, 53]
```

##### combining n and list items

### 📝 `Print`

```python

# print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n')
#     *args
#       which means you can pass any number of values.
#     sep
#       string inserted between values, default a space.
#     end
#       string appended after the last value, default a newline.
#
```

example 1

```python
li = ['samsung', 'iphone','nokia','oppo','vivo']
print(*li,sep=" and ")
# samsung and iphone and nokia and oppo and vivo
```

example 2

```python
li = [1,2,3,4]
n = len(li)
for i in range(n):
   print(li[i],end=",")
#  1,2,3,4,
```

#### `points to be noted from above table`

- The most priority goes to brackets `()`.
- the least priority goes to `=` equal to.
- Most of the operators follows `L->R` approach.
- Where as some operators follows `R->L` and they are.
  - `**`
  - `+x, -x` | unary plus and unary minus
  - logical not `not` | eg: `print( not not not True )`

##### 📝 list of operators

- =
  - a,b = 1,2
- arithmetic operator `( +, -, *, /, //, % ) and **`
  - unary +, unary - : it is called unary +, - because it has only one operand.
  - +,- ( addition and subtraction )
  - \*, / ( division ), // ( floor division ), % ( modulus )
    - `2+3+5`
    - `2+3*5`
  - \*\*

###### 📝 `most use cases of modulus operator`

- get remaining values
  - in 100 seconds , we can say 1 minutes and remaining 40 seconds there.
  - how to get this 40 remaining seconds.
  - `100//60` -> 1 | `gives how many times you can divide 100 by 60`
  - `100%60` -> 40 | `gives remaining values that will left after dividing 100 by 60`
- get last digit

---

Below example shows how you can remove each digit one by one in a number.

```python
>>> x = 1234
>>> digit = x%10 # digit = 4
>>> x = x//10 # x = 123
>>> digit = x%10 # digit = 3
>>> x = x//10 # x = 12
>>> digit = x%10 # digit = 2
>>> x = x//10 # x = 1
>>> digit = x%10 # digit = 1
>>> x = x//10 # x = 0
>>> # we will do this until the number becomes zero.
```

- repeat an index value within its limit

```python
>>> li = [ 10, 20, 30 ]
>>> n = len(li) # 3
>>> i = 0
>>> li[ i%n ] # 0%3 = 0
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 1%3 = 1
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 2%3 = 2
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 3%3 = 0
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 4%3 = 1
>>> i = i + 1
>>> # 🙀 so we can repeat a number like 012 012 012
```

```python
# A working code for above example.
word = "hello"
n = len(word)
for i in range(20):
    idx = i%n
    char = word[idx]
    print(char,end="")
# output
# hellohellohellohello
```

---

🙀 EXTRA : 🙀

```python
>>> a = 5%2 #
>>> a = -5%2 #
>>> a = 5%-2 #
>>> a = -5%-2 #
```

- while using modulus operator, result sign will be same as denominator sign.
- Internally it uses following formula,
- `Divident = divisor * Quotient + reminder`
- to find `Quotient` python uses floor division.

---

#### `Exponent operator ( ** )`

- usage is purely on maths.
- find square root and cube root

```python
>>> 2**3   #
>>> 2**1   #
>>> 2**-1  #
>>> 2**0.5   # square root
>>> 3**(1/3) # cube root
```

```python
# other examples
# ( try below example to try to find why we got that output )
>>> 4**2    # 16
>>> 5*4**2  # 80
>>> -3**2   # -9
>>> (-3)**2 #  9
>>> 4**0.5  #  2.0
>>> 4**-0.5 # 0.5
>>> 4**-2   # 0.0625
```

### Other questions

```python
>>> a = 2 + 3 + 5
>>> # 2 + 3 executes first, as we have see from left to right
>>> # 3 + 5 executes second.

>>> a = 2 + 3 * 5 # 17
>>> # 3*5 executes first as multiplication has more priority.

>>> a = (2+3)*5 # 25
>>> # () will execute first

>>> a = 5/2*3   # 7.5
>>> a = (5/2)*3 # 7.5 same result
>>> # div then multiplication
```

```python
# one of major question on (python3 vs python2)
>>> 5/2
2.5 # in python 3
>>> 5/2
2   # in python 2
```

```python
# below are example of floor division when interacting with int, float
>>> 5//2   # int - int -> int
2
>>> 5.0//2 # int - float -> float
2.0
```
