# PR

- A Pull Request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to a software project. It is commonly used in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. A PR allows developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. Once a PR is created, it can be reviewed, discussed, and eventually merged into the main codebase.

## Steps followed by companies to create a PR :

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository on the version control platform.
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine to work on it.
1. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for the feature or bug fix you are working on.
1. **Make Changes**: Implement the changes in the new branch.
1. **Commit Changes**: Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
1. **Push Changes**: Push the changes to the forked repository on the version control platform.
1. **Create a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original repository and create a pull request from your forked repository's branch.
1. **Review Process**: Team members review the pull request, suggest changes, and discuss the implementation.
1. **Address Feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on feedback and push them to the branch.
1. **Merge the PR**: Once approved, the pull request is merged into the main codebase.
1. **Close the PR**: After merging, the pull request is closed, and the branch may be deleted if no longer needed.
